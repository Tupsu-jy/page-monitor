# Step 1
start chrome with ```google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --remote-allow-origins="localhost"```. This needs to be running whne you start the script

# Step 2
login to outlier. the script does not know how to login

# Step 3
run the run.sh or if you are on windows try running run.bat. Windows one is untested though
